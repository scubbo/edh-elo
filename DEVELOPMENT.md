# Pre-commit

This repo uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). Install the tool with `pip install pre-commit` (or just `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`), then install the hooks with `pre-commit install`

Not yet configured to run this in CI, as I'm the only contributor :P but I definitely should if I start getting contributions!
