Implementation of an ELO-like algorithm.

(Yes, [this](https://github.com/sublee/elo/) exists, and a [more mathematical treatment](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/paulliu/files/www-2021-elor.pdf), but eh, a bit of self implementation doesn't hurt in a personal project)

Ref. [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130308190719/http://elo.divergentinformatics.com/) for testing, and [here](http://sradack.blogspot.com/2008/06/elo-rating-system-multiple-players.html) for implementation.
